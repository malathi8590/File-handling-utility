*DESCRIPTION*:
Title:
File Handling Utility ‚Äî Create a Java program to read, write, and modify text files

‚úÖ Objective:
Develop a simple, self-contained Java program that demonstrates basic file operations:

Write ‚Äî Create or overwrite a text file with specified content.

Read ‚Äî Read the entire contents of a text file and display it.

Modify ‚Äî Edit the file by searching for a specific word or phrase and replacing it with new text.

üóÇÔ∏è What the Program Does:
The program creates a text file (example.txt).

It writes some sample text into the file.

It reads and displays the file‚Äôs contents.

It modifies the file by replacing a given word.

It reads and shows the modified file content to confirm the change.

‚öôÔ∏è Skills and Concepts Practiced:
Java file I/O using FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter.

Using Java NIO (Files and Paths) for simple file content replacement.

Exception handling with try-with-resources to safely manage file streams.

Basic string manipulation for searching and replacing text.

üìö Outcome:
After completing this task, you will understand:

How to create, read, write, and update text files in Java.

How to safely handle file streams.

How to perform simple text processing on file content.

üéØ Deliverable:
A single, well-documented Java script (FileHandlingUtility.java) that demonstrates these operations step by step with clear console output for each stage.
