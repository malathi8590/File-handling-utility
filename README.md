*DESCRIPTION*: This Java program is a simple file handling utility that demonstrates how to perform basic file operations such as writing, reading, and modifying text files. It first creates or overwrites a file with sample content, then reads and displays that content to the user. The program also modifies the file by replacing a target word with a new word and shows the updated content. It uses standard Java I/O classes like FileReader, FileWriter, and BufferedReader along with Java NIO for efficient file manipulation. This utility helps beginners understand practical file operations and basic text processing in Java.
